# ChessBot
My brother is excellent at chess. I am not. I aim to create a machine to beat him and assert my dominance.

## The Rules
- I can't research how a chess bot works
- I can research data types, techniques etc as long as it is not in the context of chess
- The bot has exactly 10 seconds to choose an appropriate move
- I have until the end of 2024 to beat my brother

## Stack
- C# & .NET
- WPF
- Lo-Fi beats to study/relax to
